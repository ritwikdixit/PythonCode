Some small Python Projects.

Skier  
An arcade game made with PyGame. Avoid the trees, use arrow keys to turn!

Stocks  
My Stock Market Simulation Game. Users start off with $1 million
and can buy/sell stocks from the application. No APIs used, application
scrapes real time stock data from Google Finance. Rudimentary HTML parsing used
with urllib and tag finding.
Note: Data is saved in a text file, cheating is very easy as anyone
can manipulate the data by changing the text. Game was not designed for 
production.

itunes scrape  
python script to scrape data of the top 100 free apps on itunes store and store in text file:  
app name, category, size, seller, ratings
