Some small Python Projects.

Skier
An arcade game made with PyGame. Avoid the trees, use arrow keys to turn!

Stocks
My Stock Market Simulation Game. Users start off with $1 million
and can buy/sell stocks from the application. No APIs used, application
scrapes real time stock data from Google Finance. Rudimentary HTML parsing used
with urllib and tag finding.
Note: Data is saved in a text file, cheating is very easy as anyone
can manipulate the data by changing the text. Game was not designed for 
production.

PRA8 & PRA12:

Algorithms, Descriptions are written as a comment in the file.
